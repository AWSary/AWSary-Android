This model enables you to commit to a consistent amount of compute usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1- or 3-year term to get cost savings.\n\nSavings Plans can be used to optimize the cost of several computing services, most specifically AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, and Amazon EC2 instances. There are two types of Savings Plans available - Compute Savings Plans, which provide the most flexibility and can be applied to any instance family, size, region, operating system or tenancy, and EC2 Instance Savings Plans, which provide deep discounts for specific instance families in a region.\n\n## Pricing\nWith AWS Savings Plans, a user commits to a specific amount of compute usage, measured in dollars per hour, for a 1- or 3-year term. When this committed usage limit is exceeded, the standard pay-as-you-go rates apply.\n\nThe specific discount that a user receives depends on several factors, including the type of Savings Plan (Compute Savings Plan or EC2 Instance Savings Plan), the term length (1 or 3 years), the payment option (All upfront, Partial upfront, or No upfront), and whether the Savings Plan is convertible.\n\nFor a general idea, saving can range from around 10% (for lower commitment levels with No upfront payment) up to 72% (for higher commitment levels with All upfront payment).\n\n## Interesting Facts\n- Savings Plans can bring significant savings even to organizations with unpredictable workloads because they apply to compute usage across any AWS region, instance family, size, and operating system.\n- Savings Plans provide flexibility to use the discount in any way that a user sees fit, not tying the user to specific instance types.\n- AWS provides recommendations tailored to each user's usage pattern to help them identify the most cost-effective Savings Plan for their needs.\n- It's interesting to note that Savings Plans could actually encourage developers to optimize and manage their instances more effectively, in order to maximize the benefits of the plan.",

SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message oriented middleware and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work. It's a reliable, highly scalable, and simple way for applications to send, store, and receive messages. Two types of queue services are provided by Amazon SQS: the standard queue, which has a nearly unlimited number of transactions per second and the FIFO (First In First Out) queue which ensures the order of the messages.\n\n## Pricing\nWith SQS, you pay for what you use, as it has no minimum fees or upfront commitments. Pricing varies depending on the type of SQS queue used. \n\n1. **Standard Queues**: The first 1 million monthly requests are free. After that, it's $0.40 for the next 1 million requests, and then the price drops per million requests for additional messages.\n\n2. **FIFO Queues**: Pricing is the same as standard queues but FIFO Queue requests also include successful ReceiveMessage calls that didn't return a message.\n\nRemember, data transfer IN is free, but data transfer OUT is charged over 1GB per month.\n\n## Interesting Facts\n- SQS was the first service available in AWS.\n- Amazon SQS works closely with other AWS services such as Lambda, EC2, and S3.\n- Messages stored in SQS are duplicated across multiple servers for redundancy.\n- Amazon SQS allows you to exchange any volume of data, without losing messages or requiring other services to be always available.\n- Amazon SQS locks your process messages to prevent multiple producers getting the same message.",

Athena uses a managed Data Catalog to store metadata information for databases and tables, for which there is a separate fee.\n\n## Interesting Facts\n- Unlike traditional databases, with Athena, there is no infrastructure to setup or manage, and you can start analyzing data immediately. You don\u2019t even need to load your data into Athena, it works directly with data stored in S3.\n- Athena supports a wide variety of data formats including CSV, TSV, JSON and others.\n- Athena uses Presto, a distributed SQL engine to run queries. It also supports ANSI SQL.\n- Athena leverages Amazon S3 as its underlying data store, making your data highly available and durable. Amazon Athena automatically executes queries in parallel, so that you get query results in seconds, even on large datasets.",
